Hi, I'm Greg Bowler, contributor and maintainer of multiple open source projects here on Github.

The main project I'm contributing to is PHP.GT (https://github.com/phpgt) - a collection of repositories that make up [WebEngine], a tool for rapidly prototyping web products. Using WebEngine, I am building open source tools that help remove the bottlenecks of web development, such as [Authwave], [Hexform], and [API Horse].

For PHP repositories, I started [PHP Actions], a set of GitHub Actions for PHP repositories that provide a minimal footprint to individual CI tools.

## Current open source projects

Take a look at the projects I'm most excited about right now:

1. https://github.com/phpgt/ - a set of minimalist tools that make up [PHP.GT/WebEngine](https://php.gt/webengine), an application development toolkit aimed at streamlining development and respecting web technologies.
2. https://github.com/SuperHyperInstantFutureTime/ - open source music-related projects, most notably [TrackShift], an app to help independent music publishers understand their royalty payments.
3. https://getrelease.download/ - A dead simple way of downloading software release packages from Github, just with a link.
4. https://github.com/php-actions/ - A set of Github Actions to bring PHP continuous integration to projects in a consistent way - currently supporting [PHPUnit], [PHPStan], [Mess Detector] and [Code Sniffer].
5. https://github.com/Authwave/ - a tool so you never have to build user authentication again.
6. https://github.com/g105b/api.horse/ - API testing tool.
